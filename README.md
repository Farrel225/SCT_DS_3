SkillCraft Technology - Data Science Internship: Task 03

This repository contains the work for the third task of the SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship.

üìù Project Description

The goal of this task was to build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a bank's term deposit. The model was trained on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset, using customer demographic and behavioral data to make predictions. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results and key data insights.

üìä Visualizations

Here are the key charts and diagrams generated from the analysis:

1. Decision Tree Visualization
A detailed flowchart showing the decision-making logic of the trained model. Each node represents a question about a customer's attributes, leading to a final prediction.

2. Confusion Matrix Heatmap
A visual grid that breaks down the model's prediction accuracy, showing the number of correct (True Positives/Negatives) and incorrect (False Positives/Negatives) predictions.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

    Pandas (for data loading and manipulation)

    Scikit-learn (for building and evaluating the decision tree model)

    Matplotlib & Seaborn (for plotting standard visualizations)

    Jupyter Notebook/Python (as the development environment)
